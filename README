			Calculator Compiler

A tiny compiler for C-like language. Features:
	- 32bit signed integer and 32bit floating point support
	- string constants support via 'print' keyword
	- support for C-style for(;;), while() and if()
	- recursion support
	- C-style function call implementation - can be linked with C libraries
	- (g)libc independance

Requirements:
	- Linux 2.{2,4} / x86 platform
	- NASM (Netwide Assembler)
	- binutils (for linking)

To compile CALCC type `make'. This will build the
compiler (src/calcc), the libraries (lib/libcalc.a)
and test programs under test/ directory.

See test/*.calc files to get a hang of the syntax,
and examine the compiler code for details - also, when
running, the compiler is very verbose, so don't be
alarmed :-)
